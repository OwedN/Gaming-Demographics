      <br>However, all games are for everyone to play but each game will have a specific target audience for their game. While the habits for gaming can vairy from players
       that spend half a day in front of their device or the players that take breaks to do work or different activities.
      The most popular genres have to be casual gaming at <strong>71%</strong> followed by action at <strong> 53% </strong> and shooters at <strong>47%</strong>.
      These types of game can lead into bad habits of getting addicted and in some cases be aggressive from wanting to win but a lot of the time it can do a lot of good by causing relaxation and stress relief.

     <strong>Failed Technology</strong>

  <h3>
    1. Wii U
  </h3>
 
  <div3 class="container">
    <div3 class="row justify-content-md-center">
      <div3 class="col-4">
      The Wii U was released in November 2012 and was the successor 
      of the Wii which was mainly used to have a casual gaming experience. The unique features was the gamepad which allowed touch screen and duel screen play
      , even with these features the console had less that 14 million units sold in 4 years which is very low for nintendo
      . One reason it was a fail was that their message of the consoles abilities was not clear and there was a failure in game releases on schedual.
      When the switch was released it overtook the Wii U's lifetime sales in only 9 months.

      <div3 class="col-4">
      This multimedia machine was released in 1993 and was marketed as a family entertainment device.
      The main downfall of this device was the inflated price of $699.95 USD which is $1239 in 2019, this damaged its sale by a lot and 
      was a huge disaster and the life of the console was short lived.

  <h3>
    3. Virtual Boy
  </h3>

  <div3 class="container">
    <div3 class="row justify-content-md-center">
      <div3 class="col-4">
      This virtual reality system was a massive failure due to the effects it had on people, including
      eye strain, stiff necks, nausea and headaches, this was included with its high price and lack of 
      portability.
